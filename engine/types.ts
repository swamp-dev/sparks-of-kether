 *     mechanic re-derivation (Yesod's `dreamPillar` re-roll, Chokmah's
 *     `chokmahPriorAttempts++`) is layered on top by the downstream
 *     per-Sefirah tickets; `retryCount` is the canonical counter.
 *   - **Clear** when the encounter ends — pass at `prep-confirm` or
 *     `accept-setback`. Both move the encounter out of the prep cycle
 *     so the next encounter starts with a fresh envelope.
 *
 * Surface only (#334). Each per-Sefirah ticket layers its scratch

 * Chokmah `chokmahPriorAttempts`, Netzach `netzachPriorFails`, Hod
